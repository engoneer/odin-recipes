        <li>Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat.

        <li>Spread 1/3 of the sauce in the bottom of an 11x7 inch baking dish. 
            Arrange 1/2 of the ravioli over the sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella 
            cheese and 1/2 of the Monterey Jack cheese over the ravioli. Repeat layers, 
            ending with the last of the sauce on top. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over 
            the top before serving.</li>
